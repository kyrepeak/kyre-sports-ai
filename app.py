'''Kyre Sports AI entrypoint — WNBA Assists Step 12 H2H routing layer.

This wrapper preserves the exact deployed application at commit
759d0052b1d0e2a739b0618a03e1fe6e4f017dff (including WNBA Daily Picks Step 10)
and changes only the unfinished WNBA Assists fallback so the existing Assists
navigation item opens the Step-12 page.

Assists V12 preserves Steps 1–11 and adds only descriptive exact-player vs
exact-opponent assist history with small-sample and team-continuity warnings.
H2H has 0% projection influence here. SportsGameOdds, no-vig math, final assist
projection, market grading, Monte Carlo, PRA, Points, Rebounds and Daily Picks
production math remain unchanged/locked.
