'''Kyre Sports AI entrypoint — WNBA Assists Step 15 projection routing layer.

This wrapper preserves the exact deployed application at commit
759d0052b1d0e2a739b0618a03e1fe6e4f017dff (including WNBA Daily Picks Step 10)
and changes only the unfinished WNBA Assists fallback so the existing Assists
navigation item opens the Step-15 page.

Assists V15 preserves Steps 1–14, keeps the market branch (Steps 13–14) separate,
and adds only the market-independent expected-assists projection from verified
Steps 1–12. No distribution calibration, Monte Carlo, fair model odds, EV,
PRA, Points, Rebounds or Daily Picks production math is changed by this route.
